# Game-for-Ramona
A simple web project for my two-year-old's amusement. Maybe she'll learn something, too.

I certainly have.

##Concept and Goals
The goal of the game is to get the child excited about using a keyboard. Buttons are fun to press. They do things, make noises, change the screen. Along the way, they may start to learn the names of the letters.

I wanted the screen to look like a key from my Toshiba Chromebook's keyboard. When she touches a key, that letter appears in the key on the screen.

For Ramona, in particular, who goes by "Mo-Mo," I want to highlight the letters M and O. Haven't started that yet.

##Project Dependancies
I'm currently using the create.js suite, available at createjs.com. In order for the sound library, soundjs, to work, it needs to be deployed on a server. Rather than run one locally, I'm using a Chrome app called "200 OK". It can currently be found here:

##Notes
I'm *pretty* sure somebody has already done this, but I wanted to go through the process of making it from scratch.
